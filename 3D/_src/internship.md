Report 1/24/25: To get a complete overview and count of what web pages needed edited and which needed to be included, 
I spent the week going through every navigated route I could find and then recorded them into an excel sheet. I left a detailed note for each page and what each one of them needed. The list was then brought to my supervisor so he could set a priority level for which pages needed to be done first. My supervisor preferred to use Wordpress for hosting the website. I also used my time this week to more familiarize myself with its tools. As of this report, I have been able to start editing and have already published a couple of pages.</p>

Report 1/31/25: This week prioritized the publishing of complete pages. My supervisor edited and gave me the newly updated list of websites in order of importance for which I have been narrowing down the list at an efficient pace. With each page needing specific information as to its design, the supervisor has been supplying me with the context needed on a separate Word sheet. As of this report, I am fully caught up to their content in said document sheet. I will continue to draft new pages that are not yet made as to create place-holders for their upcoming development.</p>
