# Borough of Wesleyville Internship

<p class=" textBorder">
Report 1/24/25: To get a complete overview and count of what web pages needed edited and which needed to be included, 
I spent the week going through every navigated route I could find and then recorded them into an excel sheet. 
I left a detailed note for each page and what each one of them needed. The list was then brought to my supervisor so he could set a priority level for which pages needed to be done first. 
My supervisor preferred to use Wordpress for hosting the website. 
I also used my time this week to more familiarize myself with its tools. As of this report, I have been able to start editing and have already published a couple of pages.</p>

Report 1/31/25: This week prioritized the publishing of complete pages. 
My supervisor edited and gave me the newly updated list of websites in order of importance for which I have been narrowing down the list at an efficient pace. 
With each page needing specific information as to its design, the supervisor has been supplying me with the context needed on a separate Word sheet. 
As of this report, I am fully caught up to their content in said document sheet. I will continue to draft new pages that are not yet made as to create place-holders for their upcoming development.</p>

Report 2/7/25: This week is a continuation of the previous specified agenda. 
The focus of this week had an additional task to have the home page completed which includes a bio of what the Borough is about and a schedule of upcoming events. A photo gallery was also implemented to show off the beauty of Wesleyville.

Report 2/14/25: After the completion of the main page, I focused my attention to information and inquiry. The pages published to accommodate this include a contacts page for the employees of the borough office, including a list of local departments one might find convenient. 
(i.e. elected officials, Police and Fire Dep., Appeals Board, etc.) This led to the creation of the about menu catagory being processed and included in the top menu bar.

Report 2/21/25: The continuance of the about menu subcatagories was still at the forefront. I moved on to implement an event calender with the help of Savvy Citizen. 
This let me use an updatable calender that also had the extra feature of linking notifications for said events to be connected to your phone, alolng witha downloadable pdf version for a more traditional aspect. 
I finished with adding a list of closing times of the office for the new year.
The completion of the subcatagory was accomplished after adding another two pages pertaining to the history of Wesleyville Borough and an info page for Borough Careers and hiring positions, whether paid or voluntary.

Report 2/28/25: My focus pivoted to a new catagory needed in the menu; Services and Facilities. This catagory detailed information about public departments, education, parks and recreation, recycling, and a utilities page. 
Completion of public departments was prioritized first, with information about Wesleyville's police and fire department, along with an update page for the transportation office. 
The police department page includes information of emergency and non-emergency contact info, along with a public comment form. The fire department's page focused on the recruitment of volunteers and a link to a donation page. 
Finally, the transportation office page was completed with updates on what roads will have first priority of reconstruction and a timeline for said actions.
